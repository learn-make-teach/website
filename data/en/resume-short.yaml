title: Senior Java/Go developper, Solution architect
intro: "Architect but first and foremost developer, I enjoy a new challenge, learn new things and share my knowledge. I take projects from the requirements analysis all the way to production. Working in a startup taught me to be efficient and agile, while in a big company I learned to work with all sorts of technical and non technical constraints. I've been working in full remote with distributed team for the last 4 years."
